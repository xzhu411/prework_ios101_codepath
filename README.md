## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- 小红书(a chinese app similar to Instagram)
    - the feeds are in two vertical lines
    - a large portion of the home page are pictures
    
- Spotify
    - great UI design, different categories of music/podcasts are in seperate blocks
    - only three sections are in the bottom bar, easy to use
    
- Wechat
    - I can use it for almost everything
    - simple and clear design
    - I can customize what kind of 'Discover contents' I want to see (I usually delete most of them to keep my Discover page clean)
    
- Youtube
    - the openning page motion looks cool
    - feeds are in one line
    
- The app I'd like to build:

Because I procrastinate a lot, I want to build an productivity app. A lot of apps in the market I've used are not really helpful for me. They either have too many features so that I feel kind of overwhelmed to even learn how to use those apps, or their UI design is just not clear and pretty.
I want the app to have these features:

- Pomodoro(with different time range). By simple clicks, for example, giving users several default options like 1hr, 1.5hrs, or 3hrs, and each one is a botton. Of course, there'll be a customize bottom.
- A todo list. The importance of tasks will be presented in diffenrent color tint (of course there will be features to accommodate color vision deficiency). Tasks can be added into different catogaries.
- Data visualization page. Users can choose between bars and pies (or both) to present their daily, weekly or monthly data.
- Only three pages will be shown, the user profile page and setting will be at the top right corner.
- In the setting, users can customize what function to enable or disable. Some may like even simplier functions.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- At first, I didn't know where to run my app.
- For the first several times running the app, I always close the simulator, which made the process more time-consuming.
